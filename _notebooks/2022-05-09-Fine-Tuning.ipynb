So, when we're transfer learning, we'll have to cut the head off the pretrained model and give it a new head.

        "Now that we've covered most of the theory in the fastai course, we move onto practical deep learning. In theory, you have unlimited data, memory, and time. In this case, you train a huge model on all the data for a long time to get the ultimate model. However, we're limited in practice, so we have to find ways to get more data, make our models more efficient and more effective. \n",
        "\n",
        "So, we first need to get our model to overfit since that means we're reaching the limit of our model with our current data, memory, and time. \n",
        "\n",
        "To improve our training, we have to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Get, or create, more data: we can simply get more data, but sometimes we can't; so, we can add more labels to our existing data that creates additional tasks for our model to solve.\n",
        "2. Create more data through data augmentation: maybe creating more labels isn't enough; then, we can create additional synthetic data through more or different data augmentation techniques. With computer vision, Mixup tends to work very well.\n",
        "3. More generalizable architecture: we've gotten as much data as we can and we're taking advantage of all labels we can use, but we're still overfitting. Now we can actually start making changes to the model itself. We begin by thinking of ways to have a more generalizable architecture. The most basic way would be to add batch normalization.\n",
        "4. More regularization applications: so, having more generalizability was *still* not enough; okay, let's try regularization. We can try adding dropout to the last layer or two (or more like in AWD-LSTM). In general, a model with more regularization is more flexible and more accurate than a smaller model with less regularization.\n",
        "5. Simpler architectures: we leave this stage for last; if having more data and label applications, adding more generalizability, and regularization all didn't help with overfitting, maybe our model is too complicated for our task. As our final struggle, we'll move onto a smaller version of our chosen architecture, or even a simpler one in general. \n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, we don't want to start at step 5 and move up (unless it's taking up too much time or memory with your current architecture); we want to begin at the top and make our way down: reducing the size of your model reduces the capability of your model to learn subtle relationships in your data.

        "With computer vision and NLP, we often use transfer learning instead of training from scratch since we'll usually get better results while being able to use less data and spend less time, money, and effort with getting started. In fine-tuning our pretrained models, we have to cut the head off and add a new head to the pretrained body (the body is called encoder for language models). Often, the body is two linear layers with average and max concatenated pooling, dropout, and batchnorm mixed in. \n",
        "\n",
        "For NLP, we also have to apply truncated-BPTT before the new head since we're no longer predicting the next word, but classifying the text. Truncated-BPTT will give us activations for each batch where each batch's activations *remembers* something from the preceding batches. These activations are then passed to the new head. \n",
        "\n",
        "With tabular data, we can't really apply transfer learning since the tasks tend to be very different from one data set to the other. So, we just covered how fastai's `TabularModel` works by going over its `forward` function. Overall, we prepare the activations for the categorical and continuous variables before passing them into the layers of the model. \n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, we went over how to train deep learning models in practice. We want to get into a state where we overfit with our model before we try anything else. Then, we follow a procedure of getting more data, applying data augmentation, adding more generalizability, implementing regularization, and finally, reducing architecture complexity. Ideally, we only move to smaller models when we run out of time or memory.\n",

        "In the next blog, I'll remake the Siamese pair model for pet breeds we did [here](https://geon-youn.github.io/DunGeon/vision/2022/02/21/Pet-Breeds.html). Instead of having two passes to the model and comparing output labels, we'll have a single model that takes in two images and tells us if they're of the same breed. We'll review fastai's mid-level API and fine-tune the resnet architecture using the method we discussed here. We'll also have to go over how the Learner's *splitter* works since we optimize the head and body differently for the first few epochs. "
