    "With NLP (natural language processing), we can use transfer learning to train an NLP model using a pretrained language model. By using a pretrained language model, you spend less time, data, and money. But, unlike computer vision, we don't need a model that was trained on similar data. \n",

    "A **language model** is a model that was trained to predict the next word given a sequence of text. We train these models through self-supervised learning, where we don't give any labels, just a lot of text. The model can automatically (thus self-supervised) create the labels from the text and be trained on it to develop an understanding of the text's language. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, you have a pretrained language model, but it isn't the best idea to train an NLP model right away. The language model probably doesn't know the vocabulary and style (like grammar, formality, etc.) of your problem domain. So, you first fine-tune the model on the corpus of your problem domain, then fine-tune that new model to train your NLP model. \n",

While this is usually correct for English, other languages like Chinese and Japanese that don't really have spaces are better off with subword and character tokenizers. And, when spaces are special, but the languages uses many subwords like in Turkish and Hungarian, it would be better to use subword tokenizers than word tokenizers. Lastly, when a language has many characters (unlike 26 in English) like Chinese, it may be better to use character tokenizers. \n",

For subword, you have the positive that there'll be fewer tokens in each sentence, and thus have faster training, less memory, and less state for the model to remember.
